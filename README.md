# smith_waterman
Python implementation of the Smith-Waterman algorithm for local sequence alignment. Uses graph representation of scoring matrix.

### Changelog:
- 12/22/24 - Added Graph class to represent scoring matrix (without algorithm implementation yet) and Vertex class to be used by Graph class
- 12/23/24 - Within Graph class, implemented scoring method with linear gap penalty and made other edits to other methods
